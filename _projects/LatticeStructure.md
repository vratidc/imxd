## Abstract

Inter-marker interactions in marker based Augmented Reality mobile applications are limited to movement and placement. In this paper we explore multiple inter-marker interactions in the tangible AR space along with their use cases. We developed prototypes that demonstrate primarily five inter-marker interactions; namely, proximity of two or more markers, placement of makers over each other, flipping of markers, marker as a toggle and marker as a controller. These interactions are designed such that they would correlate with multiple contexts of application. To demonstrate their usage we have chosen lattice structures in Chemistry as the context. Using our prototypes and the insights from initial evaluations, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such interaction methods. We further outline the opportunities of using these interactions and extending these concepts in several other contexts.

## Introduction

The usage of augmented reality technology is spreading at an enormous scale in our everyday life. Majority of AR applications have either markerless or marker-based AR. In this paper we have have focussed on marker-based tangible AR, which involves physical movement of the markers. The number of markers (when all viewed through the same mobile device at the same time) and the interrelation between these markers have been 2 variables considered. There are applications where two 2 markers having objects A and B in view are brought closer in order to form a completely new object C in view and applications which allow movement markers translate to depth of cross section of the 3D objects. There have also been explorations where creation and destruction of markers is done using multiple interactions, which even though involve multiple hand gestures and movements, lacks interconnection between the markers. There also haven been applications which use separate devices as controllers for the AR view, but require the usage of additional hardware apart from markers. There have been a very few applications which explore the interactions between markers when multiple markers in view. Exploration of such interactions can help in explanation of concepts which have complexity and cannot be demonstrated in 2D properly in several domains.
