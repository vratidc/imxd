overview: You are a stranded space traveler whose spaceship has crash-landed on a mysterious planet. The only hope for escape lies in a powerful beam of energy, radiating from a distant star fragment on the planet’s surface. But you’re not alone. Guardians protect the maze-like path to the light, determined to keep its power hidden forever. Time is running out—will you reach the beam and escape, or be trapped on this new planet?<br><br><i>STARMAZE</i> is a competitive multiplayer VR game where two players, one in VR and the other on a mobile device compete in a time-constrained, ever-changing maze. The VR player must reach the light beam before time runs out, while the mobile player uses their strategic abilities to control the maze and prevent them from winning.
