## ABSTRACT

VR narratives provide viewers with the feeling of being immersed in a story environment by giving them the freedom to look
around and change their point-of-view during the experience. Storytellers use various techniques to guide the viewers to important
plot points in a VR narrative. Previous studies have examined various methods to design narratives for 360-degree VR films with
linear and non-linear narratives. In this study, we look at the grammar of storytelling in a real-time 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) VR
experience. We created ’Belonging’, a real-time VR narrative in which one has the freedom to experience the story by physically
moving around in the environment and changing point-of-view as the story progresses. Through this project, we intend to explore
design-related aspects of narrative and associated technical challenges for creating a compelling 6DoF real-time VR experience. In this
narrative, we focus on the audio and visual cues that would effectively guide the viewers to the plot points.

## Introduction

VR filmmaking challenges traditional storytelling. While traditional films confine viewers to a fixed perspective, VR immerses users in 360-degree environments, allowing them to freely explore and choose their own viewpoint. This freedom presents unique challenges for storytellers who must guide the user's attention effectively.

Previous research has explored how visual and audio cues can influence user experience in linear VR narratives. However, real-time 6DoF VR films, where users can both look around and move within the environment, offer new possibilities and require innovative storytelling techniques.

This project aims to investigate the grammar of storytelling in 6DoF VR, particularly focusing on the role of audio and visual cues in shaping the narrative experience. By understanding these techniques, we can create more engaging and impactful VR films.
