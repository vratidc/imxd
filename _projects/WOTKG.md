## Synopsis

Rakhandar, the mythical protective spirit of the area, demonstrates a
fascinating duality in his identity. He can be mischievous, unforgiving, or
fiercely protective towards the region's residents. This multifaceted nature
adds depth and intrigue to the legends surrounding Rakhandar, making him
an enigmatic figure in local folklore. By sharing these local stories on a
broader platform, the project aims to preserve and celebrate the cultural
heritage of the Konkan region while fostering a deeper understanding and
appreciation of its mythology and traditions.

## Background

The concept of a protective spirit responsible for cultural, ecological, and
social preservation is widespread in and around the Konkan Region.
However, very little is known about the accompanying culture and the
coexistence of spirit gods. Numerous stories circulate about colossal
spirits that generally patrol an area late at night, ensuring that there are no
miscreants waiting to wreak havoc.

## Research

### Primary Research
The primary research for this study involved firsthand accounts gathered through personal interactions with individuals who had either heard about Rakhandar or had direct experiences related to this fascinating entity. Additionally, visits were made to the Rakhandar shrines. Through these interactions and observations, a wide range of narratives surrounding Rakhandar worship were collected, encompassing both chilling and humorous anecdotes.

### Secondary Reserach

The inclusion of audiovisual content, such as religious songs, horror stories, and narrated tales, has enriched our comprehension of how these stories are transmitted through spoken words.

## Experience

An interactive digital story centered around Rakhandar is brought to a broader audience
through the character of a fourteen-year-old city dweller, Sarvesh, returning to his
maternal village. The culture surrounding Rakhandar is revealed through multiple
interactions with the village folk. These interactions contribute to an intriguing story that
the user unravels as the narrative progresses. Players control Sarvesh in a third-person
game view, allowing them to navigate the village, interact with different characters, hear
their accounts of the spirit god Rakhandar, and engage with authentic Konkani
elements such as a local alcohol distillery, Kaavi art, among others. This journey is
designed to be quirky, sometimes mischievous, and to reflect the subtleties of Konkani
community interdependencies and dynamics.

The gameplay design is executed in the Unity Engine, incorporating custom assets
created in Blender and Character Creator for in-game characters. Using Unity's built-in
environment tool, a space was designed where the player can move around and visit
different areas based on mission requirements. A companion character, Pranav, follows
the main character, directing the player to the right places on the map. All in-game UI
elements draw inspiration from Kaavi art, a mural form prevalent in the Konkan region,
especially in the temples of Goa, coastal Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
Currently, the game is optimized for the Windows platform, allowing character control
through keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Outcomes

This work and research was presented at IndiaHCI 2023.
